It just worked. An awesome developer experience coupled with a model that is always at the bleeding edge of what&amp;rsquo;s possible is what catalyzed this boom of rapid AI-enabled apps to be developed and shipped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open source models were for those deep in pushing the models to do specific things, but to get the level of intelligence that OpenAI provides via ~2min setup, you needed expensive hardware, time sunk into getting the models running. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t ship nearly as fast. For all of the AI tinkering that I did, if I had to configure spinning up models I would not have explored the problem space of LLMs nearly as much.
