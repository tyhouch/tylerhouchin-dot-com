      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the future, your ability to create software won&amp;rsquo;t be limited by your technical knowledge. It will be limited by how clearly you can think.&#xA;Computing started with physical machines - we had to manually arrange circuits and transistors to make anything happen. Then we invented ways to encode instructions using just 1s and 0s. Next came human-readable instructions in assembly language. Then high-level languages like Python that let us write code almost like English. Now we&amp;rsquo;re at LLMs that can turn plain English into working software. Each breakthrough moved us further from thinking like machines and closer to thinking like humans.&#xA;But here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s really interesting: the next abstraction won&amp;rsquo;t be technical at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
