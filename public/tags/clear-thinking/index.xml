It will be limited by how clearly you can think.
Computing started with physical machines - we had to manually arrange circuits and transistors to make anything happen. Then we invented ways to encode instructions using just 1s and 0s. Next came human-readable instructions in assembly language. Then high-level languages like Python that let us write code almost like English. Now we&amp;rsquo;re at LLMs that can turn plain English into working software. Each breakthrough moved us further from thinking like machines and closer to thinking like humans.
But here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s really interesting: the next abstraction won&amp;rsquo;t be technical at all.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
