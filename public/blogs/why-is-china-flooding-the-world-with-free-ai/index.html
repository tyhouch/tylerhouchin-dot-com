However, it seems for every update to GPT/Claude/Gemini, we get 10 updates (or net new releases) from Chinese labs. This began exciting - progress is progress. But it has started to feel eerie. Why is China doing this? Almost all of the improvements made in open source LLMs have been at the hands of the Chinese.</p><p>On the news and you&rsquo;ll see countless discussions about &ldquo;The AI Race&rdquo; that we are participating in with China. There is much less disucssion about the vastly different strategies that the US and China are taking to win this race. When a US lab releases a new model, the offer it (1) through their &lsquo;chatbot&rsquo; product and (2) via their API for others to build with. Compare this to a Chinese lab: they release the model directly on Huggingface, where end users download the entire model and run it themselves.</p><p>Giving away the model weights seems altruistic, but it cannot be. This <em>is</em> China we&rsquo;re taking about&mldr; so the question remains: Why is China giving away their LLMs while US holds theirs behind lock and key?</p><h2 id=the-open-source-flood>The Open Source Flood</h2><p>Over the past year, Chinese companies have released an absurd number of open source AI models. DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax - new ones every few weeks, all under permissive licenses, weights available for anyone to download.</p><p>And these aren&rsquo;t second-tier models. As of November 2025, the leaderboard has Kimi K2 Instruct as the leading open source model. It&rsquo;s competitive with leading US closed models (GPT-5, Gemini 3, Claude 4.5 Opus) and significantly better than any US open source alternative.</p><p>Before 2025, open source AI moved slowly. Then 2025 hit: DeepSeek R1 in January, Qwen 3 in March, MiniMax M1 in summer, Kimi K2 and GLM-4.5 in July, then ByteDance models, more Qwen releases, even Meituan (China&rsquo;s DoorDash) releasing a trillion-parameter model.</p><p>These companies are spending millions on training and giving the results away. That seems insane, but they were never going to make money on models anyway.</p><h2 id=why-the-us-charges-and-china-cant>Why the US Charges and China Can&rsquo;t</h2><p>The US strategy is straightforward: train expensive models, monetize through APIs and subscriptions. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can do this because they have paying customers. Enterprises will pay for GPT-5 API access. Consumers will pay $20/month for ChatGPT. The model is the product.</p><p>This works because US companies have access to the market that matters most - Western enterprises with AI budgets. No Fortune 500 CISO is going to approve production data flowing through a Chinese AI service, but they&rsquo;ll happily sign an OpenAI contract.</p><p>Chinese companies don&rsquo;t have this option. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all blocked access from China in 2022. Not because China banned them - the US companies chose to cut off access. That means Chinese AI companies have zero path to selling API access to Western enterprises.</p><p>And domestically, the economics collapsed immediately. When DeepSeek open-sourced R1, Baidu announced they&rsquo;d open-source Ernie. Then Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance - everyone followed within weeks. If your competitor releases a frontier model for free, you can&rsquo;t charge for yours.</p><p>So Chinese AI companies found themselves boxed out internationally (blocked by Western companies) and commoditized domestically (competitors giving models away). The API business model that funds OpenAI and Anthropic was dead on arrival.</p><h2 id=state-funding-changes-the-math>State Funding Changes the Math</h2><p>As we assume with Chinese companies, State funding reshapes the economics. DeepSeek&rsquo;s parent company got designated a &ldquo;national high-tech enterprise&rdquo; in 2023 which provided them tax breaks, subsidies, and state-backed capital. The founder met with Premier Li Qiang (#2 to Xi) in early 2024. After R1 launched, Bank of China announced a $137 billion AI infrastructure fund.</p><p>When the government is funding your compute, ROI isn&rsquo;t measured at the company level. It&rsquo;s measured nationally.</p><p>This is where the strategy begins to get clearer. If you can&rsquo;t make money on models, what do you do with them?</p><p><strong>You use them to sell hardware.</strong></p><p>China is still under US chip export controls and can&rsquo;t (easily) get the best Nvidia GPUs. So Chinese companies optimized their models to run on Huawei Ascend chips. DeepSeek V3.2 launched with first-day support for Huawei&rsquo;s CANN software stack.</p><p><strong>If DeepSeek and Qwen become the global default and they&rsquo;re optimized to run on Chinese chips, demand flows toward Chinese semiconductors instead of Nvidia.</strong></p><p>The hardware strategy extends beyond just the chips used to run the LLMs. Over half of publicly listed humanoid robotics companies are Chinese. DJI dominates drones. China manufactures most AI-enabled consumer devices globally.</p><h2 id=the-commoditization-thesis>The Commoditization Thesis</h2><p>Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure AI, said it directly when ending their OpenAI partnership in February 2025: &ldquo;LLMs are getting smarter yet more commoditized. For us, LLMs have quickly become the smallest piece of the puzzle.&rdquo;</p><p>If models become commoditized, the money flows elsewhere. To the bottom of the stack: infrastructure to run the models. To the top of the stack: applications and devices that use them. And to the middle: the ecosystem of developers building on top.</p><p>China looked at this landscape and made a bet: we can&rsquo;t win the model monetization game, so let&rsquo;s accelerate commoditization and win everything else.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an irony in how this happened. US export controls were supposed to slow China&rsquo;s AI development by restricting access to advanced chips. Instead, they forced innovation.</p><h2 id=where-this-leaves-us>Where This Leaves Us</h2><p>China has proven remarkably adaptable. Western markets closed to them? Fine, can&rsquo;t monetize there anyway. Domestic competition destroyed pricing power? Fine, state funding removes the need for returns. Can&rsquo;t get Nvidia chips? Fine, optimize for Huawei and build that ecosystem instead.</p><p>The strategy crystallizes: free models create demand for Chinese hardware (chips, robots, consumer devices) and capture the developer ecosystem that builds on top. The models were never the product. They&rsquo;re the distribution mechanism.</p><p>The US is betting that closed, monetizable models will fund the research needed to stay ahead. China is betting that commoditized, free models will let them win on hardware and ecosystem even if they&rsquo;re not always at the frontier.</p><p>Both strategies are coherent. We&rsquo;re about to find out which one wins.</p><hr><h2 id=sources>Sources</h2><p><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> <a href=https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models>Artificial Analysis</a><br><strong>Policy:</strong> <a href=https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/>China&rsquo;s 2017 AI Development Plan</a>, <a href=https://www.europeanguanxi.com/post/from-policy-blueprint-to-industrial-practice-china-s-embrace-of-open-weight-ai>European Guanxi on China&rsquo;s Open-Weight Strategy</a>, <a href=https://merics.org/en/report/chinas-ai-development-model-era-technological-deglobalization>MERICS on China&rsquo;s AI Model</a><br><strong>Analysis:</strong> <a href=https://thediplomat.com/2025/07/china-now-dominates-open-source-ai-how-much-does-that-matter/>The Diplomat on Chinese Open Source Dominance</a>, <a href=https://www.getlago.com/blog/deepseek-open-source>GetLago on DeepSeek Economics</a><br><strong>Hardware:</strong> <a href=https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/deepseek-new-model-supports-huawei-cann>Tom&rsquo;s Hardware on DeepSeek + Chinese Chips</a>, <a href=https://merics.org/en/report/chinas-drive-toward-self-reliance-artificial-intelligence-chips-large-language-models>MERICS on Hardware Self-Reliance</a>, <a href=https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-11-28-gdi>Hazy Research on Gross Domestic Intelligence</a><br><strong>Funding:</strong> <a href=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/front-line-chinas-ai-ambitions-134830733.html>Yahoo on Zhipu AI State Backing</a></p></div><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flex><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/blogs/to-rent-or-own-your-ai-brain/>To Rent or Own Your AI Brains</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p>Powered by
